# QUIZ WHIZZ

## Purpose and Value
### User goals
- To play a quiz game about films and test their knowledge
Website goals
- For the user to find the format and layout of the quiz website obvious and easy to navigate
- To provide a fun game with 10 – 50 questions about films to users

### User Stories

> A couple who want to add a quiz game into their Friday Game nights when they have friends over. They want to play the game on their laptop so the questions and answers are big for everyone to see. They want to be able to get straight on to the game, and access the rules easily at any time.

> A man who likes to do puzzles and quizzes on his very long commute to work. He want to have the option to play with lots of questions to keep him entertained. He would like the game to easily function from the web on a mobile device without needing to scroll or spend too much time figuring out how the website works.

## Competitor Review

I’ve reviewed a few quiz related websites, including [Sporcle]( https://www.sporcle.com/?refresh) and [Buzzfeed Quizzes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/uk/quizzes).
### Pros

Sporcle

- Each quiz is easy to use, the user doesn’t need to figure out how to play.
- The game keeps a running score total

Buzzfeed

- The film questions have images to go with them, so the user can see a snippet of the movie if they’re unsure on the title.

### Cons
Sporcle

- Home page and game page layouts is very crowded and confusing for the user.

Buzzfeed

- The quiz runs in a linear layout, rather than each new question being displayed where the previous one was. This added to the busy layout with adverts for other quizzes means it’s unclear for the user where the quiz starts and ends.

## Objectives
- To provide easy access to the game on the home page
- To provide a Rules page to explain how the game works
- To give options for different genre’s of quiz
- To give options for how many questions the user wants in the game
- To keep a running score and show the total score at the end

![Scattergraph of the Objectives, Importance and Viability/Feasibility table](/assets/images/readme/objectives-scatter-graph.PNG "Objectives, Importance and Viability/Feasibility table")

From the scatter graph above, I have decided to focus on the following four objectives:
- To provide easy access to the game on the home page
- To provide a Rules page to explain how the game works
- To give options for how many questions the user wants in the game
- To keep a running score and show the total score at the end

In the future, I would like to add additional quizzes to the website so the user can choose between a Movies quiz, a TV show quiz and a Music quiz.

## Structure

I have chosen to create the website with five different pages. This is so that the user will be able to see clear difference between where the game is, where the rules are, and the home page. These five pages are:

- Home page
- Setup page – to ask the user how many questions they want
- Game page – the page where the user plays the quiz game
- Score page – the page where the user is told their total score after completing the quiz
- Rules page – where the user can check how the quiz works and what the rules are.
